## Understanding Cricket and the T-20 World Cup

**Cricket** is a popular sport played between two teams, typically comprising eleven players each. The game involves batting, where players score runs by hitting a ball with a bat, and bowling, where the objective is to dismiss the batsmen by hitting the wickets with the ball or causing them to make mistakes that lead to an out. Matches are played on a circular or oval-shaped field with a rectangular pitch at the center.

**The T-20 World Cup** is an international cricket tournament and one of the sport's most exciting formats, known as Twenty20 (T20). Each team plays a single innings, batting for a maximum of 20 overs (120 legal balls), making the game fast-paced and spectator-friendly. The T-20 World Cup features teams from various countries competing to win the global title, celebrated for its high-energy matches and massive fan following.
